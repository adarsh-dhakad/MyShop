        <b>PRICING</b>
        <i>
            "List Price" means the suggested retail price of a product as provided by a manufacturer,
            supplier, or seller.
            We regularly check List Prices against prices recently found on My Store and other retailers.
            Certain products may have a "Was Price" displayed, which is determined using recent price history
            of the product on My Store.
            With respect to items sold by My Store, we cannot confirm the price of an item until you order.
            Despite our best efforts, a small number of the items in our catalog may be mispriced.
            If the correct price of an item sold by My Store is higher than our stated price,
            we will, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions before shipping or cancel
            your order and notify you of such cancellation. Other merchants may follow different policies
            in the event of a mispriced item.
            We generally do not charge your credit card until after your order has entered the shipping process or,
            for digital products, until we make the digital product available to you.

        <h4>Refunds</h4>
        <i>When you return an item, your refund amount and refund method may vary.
            You can check the payment method that was refunded and the status of your refund in Your Orders.
        After the carrier has received your item, it can take up to two weeks for us to receive and process your return.
